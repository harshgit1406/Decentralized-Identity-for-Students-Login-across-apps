# Decentralized Identity for Students – Login across apps

## Project Description

The Decentralized Identity for Students project is a blockchain-based smart contract solution built on the Aptos network that enables students to create and manage a unified digital identity. This identity can be used to authenticate and access multiple educational applications and platforms without the need for separate registration processes on each platform.

The smart contract provides a secure, decentralized way for students to store their academic credentials and identity information on-chain, while maintaining privacy and control over their personal data. Educational apps and platforms can verify student authenticity through this decentralized system, creating a seamless login experience across the entire educational ecosystem.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the way students interact with educational technology by creating a unified, secure, and student-controlled identity management system. We aim to eliminate the friction of multiple registrations, reduce identity fraud in educational settings, and empower students with complete ownership of their academic identity data.

By leveraging blockchain technology, we envision a future where students can seamlessly access any educational platform, carry their verified credentials across institutions, and maintain a permanent, tamper-proof record of their academic journey that follows them throughout their educational career.
